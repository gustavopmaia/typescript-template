  - `components/`: This directory contains all the React components used in the application, such as `Box` and `Footer`.
  - `services/`: This directory is for any services that the application might use, such as Axios.
  - `pages/`: This directory is for the different pages of the application.
- `public/`: This directory is for public assets that are to be served directly by the server.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the `web/` directory and run the following command:

```sh
npm install
